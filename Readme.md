## Introduction

PeriFlakes is an open source solver of state-based peridynamics. 
It is built off of cornflakes/popcorn and can autogenerate every possible formulation found in the literature, and then some more.
Notably, the system uses symbolic differentation to obtain the expressions for tangent matrices to use implicit time steppers or solve static equilibrium.
This is an updated version of the code used to perform the study in

in which the algorithms and formulations are described in detail.

## Conclusions 

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate the limitations of Peridynamic theory.
